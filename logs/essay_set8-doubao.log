A rating of 1-6 on the following four traits:
1. Ideas and Content

•	clarity, focus, and control.
•	main idea(s) that stand out.
•	supporting, relevant, carefully selected details; when appropriate, use of resources provides strong, accurate, credible support.
•	a thorough, balanced, in-depth explanation / exploration of the topic; the writing makes connections and shares insights.
•	content and selected details that are well-suited to audience and purpose.
Score 5: The writing is clear, focused and interesting. It holds the reader’s attention. Main ideas stand out and are developed by supporting details suitable to audience and purpose. The writing is characterized by
•	clarity, focus, and control.

•	a thorough, balanced explanation / exploration of the topic; the writing makes connections and shares insights.
•	content and selected details that are well-suited to audience and purpose.
Score 4: The writing is clear and focused. The reader can easily understand the main ideas. Support is present, although it may be limited or rather general. The writing is characterized by
•	an easily identifiable purpose.
•	clear main idea(s).
•	supporting details that are relevant, but may be overly general or limited in places; when appropriate, resources are used to provide accurate support.
•	a topic that is explored / explained, although developmental details may occasionally be out of balance with the main idea(s); some connections and insights may be present.
•	content and selected details that are relevant, but perhaps not consistently well-chosen for audience and purpose.
Score 3: The reader can understand the main ideas, although they may be overly broad or simplistic, and the results may not be effective. Supporting detail is often limited, insubstantial, overly general, or occasionally slightly off-topic. The writing is characterized by
•	an easily identifiable purpose and main idea(s).
•	predictable or overly-obvious main ideas; or points that echo observations heard elsewhere; or a close retelling of another work.
•	support that is attempted, but developmental details are often limited, uneven, somewhat off-topic, predictable, or too general (e.g., a list of underdeveloped points).
•	details that may not be well-grounded in credible resources; they may be based on clichés, stereotypes or questionable sources of information.
•	difficulties when moving from general observations to specifics.
Score 2: Main ideas and purpose are somewhat unclear or development is attempted but minimal. The writing is characterized by
•	a purpose and main idea(s) that may require extensive inferences by the reader.

•	a body that is easy to follow with details that fit where placed.
•	transitions that may be stilted or formulaic.
•	organization which helps the reader, despite some weaknesses.
Score 3: An attempt has been made to organize the writing; however, the overall structure is inconsistent or skeletal. The writing is characterized by

•	a structure that is skeletal or too rigid.
•	placement of details that may not always be effective.
•	organization which lapses in some places, but helps the reader in others.

An occasional organizational device is discernible; however, the writing is either difficult to follow and the reader has to reread substantial portions, or the piece is simply too short to demonstrate organizational skills. The writing is characterized by
•	some attempts at sequencing, but the order or the relationship among ideas is frequently unclear; a lack of paragraph breaks.
•	a missing or extremely undeveloped beginning, body, and/or ending.
•	a lack of transitions, or when present, ineffective or overused.

Score 3: The writing tends to be mechanical rather than fluid. Occasional awkward constructions may force the reader to slow down or reread. The writing is characterized by
•	some passages that invite fluid oral reading; however, others do not.
•	some variety in sentence structure, length, and beginnings, although the writer falls into repetitive sentence patterns.
•	good control over simple sentence structures, but little control over more complex sentences; fragments, if present, may not be effective.
•	sentences which, although functional, lack energy.
•	lapses in stylistic control; dialogue, if used, may sound stilted or unnatural.
•	text that is too short to demonstrate variety and control.
Score 2: The writing tends to be either choppy or rambling. Awkward constructions often force the reader to slow down or reread. The writing is characterized by

Errors are so few and so minor that the reader can easily skim right over them unless specifically searching for them. The writing is characterized by
•	strong control of conventions; manipulation of conventions may occur for stylistic effect.
•	strong, effective use of punctuation that guides the reader through the text.
•	correct spelling, even of more difficult words.
•	correct grammar and usage that contribute to clarity and style.
•	skill in using a wide range of conventions in a sufficiently long and complex piece.

•	some control over basic conventions; the text may be too simple or too short to reveal mastery.
•	end-of-sentence punctuation that is usually correct; however, internal punctuation contains frequent errors.
•	spelling errors that distract the reader; misspelling of common words occurs.
•	capitalization errors.
•	errors in grammar and usage that do not block meaning but do distract the reader.
•	significant need for editing.
Score 2: The writing demonstrates little control of standard writing conventions. Frequent, significant errors impede readability. The writing is characterized by
