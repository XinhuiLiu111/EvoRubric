Explanation: Rubric B seems to be more detailed and comprehensive in its descriptions for each score level. So, we have kept 100% of the criteria from Rubric B as it better meets the requirements for stability, consistency, and providing clear evaluation guidelines. We have maintained the exact scoring ranges, level structure, and fundamental evaluation approach as in the original rubrics, while also ensuring that the criteria are specific, observable, and applicable across different essay topics.
