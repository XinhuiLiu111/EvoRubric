Explanation: Rubric A seems to be more detailed in its descriptions for each score point. So, we keep the majority of the criteria from Rubric A. Rubric B has some elements that are already covered in Rubric A in a more detailed way, so we don't add any new elements from Rubric B. The overall structure, scoring ranges, and fundamental evaluation approach remain the same as in the original Rubric A, which meets all the requirements for creating a more stable and effective rubric.
