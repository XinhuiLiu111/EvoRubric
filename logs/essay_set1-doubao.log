  "Score Point 2 - 3": "An extremely undeveloped response that takes a position with almost no support.

For example, if discussing a topic about environmental protection, the details might be something like 'trees are important' without any elaboration on how or why.\n•	Is severely awkward and fragmented, with multiple run - on or incomplete sentences. Sentences may lack proper subject - verb agreement, such as 'Running in the park, the trees seem beautiful' (where the subject of 'running' is incorrectly associated with 'trees').\n•	Is very difficult to read and understand due to poor grammar, spelling, and punctuation. There may be numerous misspelled words like 'enviroment' and incorrect punctuation that disrupt the flow of the text.\n•	Shows no awareness of audience.

Wind energy is also expanding rapidly, with larger and more powerful turbines being developed, and it has the potential to meet a substantial portion of global energy demands. Hydroelectric power, although limited in some areas, has been a reliable source of clean energy for decades and can be further optimized. Geothermal energy offers a constant source of power, tapping into the Earth's natural heat. Biomass energy can utilize organic materials, reducing waste and providing a renewable alternative. These reasons, along with numerous case studies and real - world examples, paint a comprehensive picture of the viability of renewable energy.'\n•	Exhibits a strong organizational structure, with a clear and logical progression of ideas, and sophisticated transitional language.
