            "Is it difficult for the reader to discern the main idea?": "Yes, the main idea is unclear or absent. The essay does not convey a coherent message, and the reader may struggle to understand what the writer is trying to say. The writing might seem like a jumble of words without a central point.",
            "too brief or too repetitive to establish or maintain a focus?": "Yes, the writing may be very short or repetitive, making it hard to follow. The lack of focus and brevity prevent the development of any meaningful ideas. It might repeat the same sentence or idea over and over without going anywhere.",
            "Does the writing sample include very few relevant ideas?": "Yes",
            "Does it include little information with few or no details or unrelated details?": "Yes, there is scant relevant information and either no details or irrelevant ones.

It might start and end abruptly, and there is no clear development of ideas in between.",
            "Is it difficult to follow, with the order possibly difficult to discern?": "Yes, the sequence of ideas is hard to understand. The lack of organization makes it impossible for the reader to follow the flow of the argument. The ideas seem to be presented randomly, and there is no sense of a logical progression.",
            "Are transitions weak or absent (e.g., without topic sentences)?": "Yes, there are no effective transitions. The absence of transitions further confuses the reader and makes it difficult to connect the ideas. There are no words or phrases to show how one thought relates to another, and there are no topic sentences to guide the reader.",
            "Is the overall organization of the essay non-existent or extremely chaotic, making it incomprehensible?": "Yes, the organization is completely lacking, and the essay is a jumbled mess that cannot be understood."

In a formal essay, very casual or slang language might be used.",
            "Does it demonstrate a lack of a sense of audience?": "Yes, there is no awareness of the audience. The writer does not consider the reader's needs, interests, or level of understanding, and the writing is not tailored to the intended audience. The content might be presented in a way that is too complex or too simple for the audience, and there is no attempt to make it accessible or engaging.",
