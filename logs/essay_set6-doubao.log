  "Score Point 1": "The response provides a minimal and often unclear description of the obstacles faced by the Empire State Building's builders in allowing dirigibles to dock. It contains only a small amount of information from the excerpt, and there are likely multiple misinterpretations. The response may seem disjointed, with a tenuous connection to the relevant content. The language used is imprecise, making it difficult to determine the writer's understanding of the topic.",
  "Score Point 0": "The response is completely off - topic, presenting no relevant information related to the obstacles the Empire State Building's builders faced in allowing dirigibles to dock. It fails to address the task at hand and does not contain any content that can be related to the excerpt.

{
  "Score Point 4": "The response provides an extremely detailed, accurate, and comprehensive account of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. It includes at least three distinct, highly specific, and relevant pieces of information directly from the excerpt, such as precise measurements, detailed descriptions of structural limitations, or specific engineering challenges. The description is meticulously organized and presented in a clear and logical manner, with each piece of information building upon the others to create a complete and cohesive understanding of the situation.",
  "Score Point 3": "The response offers a clear and mostly complete description of the obstacles. It contains two relevant and reasonably specific pieces of information from the excerpt, which are specific enough to convey a solid understanding of the situation. For example, it might mention key design features or operational constraints. However, it may lack some depth or detail in certain aspects, such as not fully elaborating on the implications of a particular obstacle, or the information presented may be a bit more general than in the Score Point 4 response.",
  "Score Point 2": "The response presents a partial description of the obstacles. It includes one piece of information from the excerpt, and while there may be some minor inaccuracies or a lack of full elaboration, it still indicates a basic understanding of the topic. The detail provided is not as comprehensive or specific as those in higher - scoring responses, and there may be gaps in the understanding of the text. For instance, the information might be a broad statement without much context or explanation.",
  "Score Point 1": "The response offers a minimal description of the obstacles. It has very little information from the excerpt, and what is included may be inaccurate or misinterpreted. The connection to the task is weak, with the response either being tangential or only superficially related to the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building regarding dirigible docking. For example, it might mention something only vaguely related to the building or dirigibles without actually addressing the docking obstacles.",
  "Score Point 0": "The response is completely off - topic, incorrect, or contains so little relevant information that it fails to show any comprehension of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
